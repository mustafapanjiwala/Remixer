> Remixer is a native mobile application to listen to relaxing music on a single tap. Here you can listen to diffrent relaxing sounds when you feel stressed or want to focus on your work. You can also control the volume within the app itself. Once the music is downloaded, it is not required to have internet next time to play the music. It is just a basic app for soothing sounds.

## Install

```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

```sh
expo start
```
